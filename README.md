# FairTCD: Temporal Contrastive Distillation for Twofold Fairness in Dynamic Graphs

This repository contains the implementation of **FairTCD**, a dynamic graph learning framework that achieves *twofold fairness* by jointly considering **attribute fairness** and **structural fairness** through **Dual-Teacher Temporal Contrastive Distillation**.
